### Project Work:

**Project 1: Comparison of Gene Regulatory Networks (scGRN)**  
This project examines gene regulatory networks in humans and mice using the scGRN database. The goal is to explore differences in network complexity, such as size, connectivity, the number of cycles, and hierarchical or modular organization. Additionally, the project aims to identify any similarities in the architectures of these networks compared to random networks.

**Project 2: Protein Structure Complexity (AlphaFold)**  
In this project, we investigate the complexity of different categories of proteins, using predictions from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. Key areas of focus include whether functional categories, such as enzymes and transcription factors, exhibit systematic differences in complexity, and how methods from information theory or fractal geometry can quantify this complexity.

**Project 3: Gene Expression in Cancer Treatment (CDS-DB & scGRN)**  
This project studies gene expression changes in cancer patients before and after treatment, utilizing data from CDS-DB. The goal is to map these changes onto the gene regulatory network from scGRN and assess whether the data can be integrated smoothly. Additionally, it will explore ways to quantify how gene sets are distributed within the network.

**Project 4: Comparison of Drug Databases (DrugBank & pharmGWAS)**  
Here, we compare drug-related data from DrugBank and pharmGWAS. The aim is to determine if drug sets between the two databases are comparable and whether genetic-based drug categories from pharmGWAS align with those in DrugBank, which are based on drug applications and phenotypic information.
